# DeepAgent: How the New AI Agent Learns, Thinks, and Builds Its Own Tools

(Original article: https://medium.com/coding-nexus/deepagent-how-the-new-ai-agent-learns-thinks-and-builds-its-own-tools-a7f38c336400)

When I first read about DeepAgent, I couldn't help but pause and wonder — **what does it truly mean for an AI to discover its own tools?**

For years, I've observed AI agents perform impressive tasks — browsing the web, executing code snippets, and planning their next moves. However, behind that illusion of independence, most of them follow prewritten recipes. Their creators already predetermine every action, every tool, every "smart" decision.

DeepAgent, however, **flips that script**. It's not just about following instructions — it's about **analyzing** them.

---

## 🤔 Think: The Trouble with Today's AI Agents

Here's how most AI agents work right now:

They **plan, act, observe, repeat**.

Something like this:

```python
while not task_done:
    plan_next_step()
    call_tool()
    observe_result()
```

That pattern is tidy, predictable… and **boring**.

The issue is that **real-world tasks don't follow neat loops**.

Imagine researching a movie, analyzing audience trends, and comparing them to Spotify music data. Halfway through, you realize you need a new API or a different approach. Most agents would get stuck — **they don't know how to find new tools on their own**.

They lack what we might refer to as **adaptive intelligence** — the capacity to step back, reconsider, and modify their approach.

### Traditional Agent Architecture

The diagram above shows the fundamental difference:
- **Traditional agents** follow predefined workflows with fixed toolsets
- **DeepAgent** dynamically discovers and integrates tools during reasoning

---

## 💡 Explain: What Makes DeepAgent Different?

**DeepAgent** is a novel framework created by researchers at **Renmin University** and **Xiaohongshu**.

It makes a significant step forward by letting AI agents **think, discover, and act** — all within a seamless flow of reasoning.

Instead of being given a fixed toolbox, DeepAgent can **find and utilize new tools as needed**, based on the task at hand.

### The Core Reasoning Process

Here's what its thought process looks like in a simplified form:

```python
def DeepAgent(task):
    while not task.complete():
        thought = think()
        if needs_tool(thought):
            tool = search_tool(thought)
            result = call_tool(tool)
        if stuck():
            fold_memory()
        update_plan(thought, result)
```

That's the difference between **following a recipe** and actually **learning to cook**.

## 🎨 Visualize: DeepAgent's Reasoning Architecture

<DeepAgentReasoningFlow />

The visualization above shows DeepAgent's main reasoning process with three key components:

1. **Tool Discovery**: Autonomous search and retrieval from extensive tool databases
2. **Memory Management**: Dynamic folding when context becomes overwhelming
3. **Adaptive Reasoning**: Continuous thought process that adjusts based on results

---

## 🧠 Think: How "Memory Folding" Helps It Think Better

One of my favorite ideas from this paper is what they term **Autonomous Memory Folding**.

It's exactly what it sounds like — the agent learns to **fold its memory when things become too cluttered**.

Instead of recalling every single detail (which would overwhelm even the largest model), it organizes its experience into three neat "drawers":

- **Episodic Memory**: What's happened so far
- **Working Memory**: What it's doing right now
- **Tool Memory**: What tools worked (or failed) in the past

Think of it as a human researcher **pausing to jot down notes** before moving on to the next task.

### Memory Structure in Code

Here's a simplified version of how it might appear behind the scenes:

```json
{
  "episodic": ["searched Spotify", "parsed movie reviews"],
  "working": {
    "goal": "summarize insights",
    "status": "in-progress"
  },
  "tool_memory": {
    "used": ["spotify.search", "tmdb.api"],
    "success_rate": 0.92
  }
}
```

By condensing what matters and discarding what doesn't, DeepAgent can **"take a breath,"** reset its mind, and move forward smarter.

## 🎨 Visualize: Memory Folding Process

<MemoryFoldingVisualization />

The interactive diagram above demonstrates how DeepAgent manages its memory:

1. **Before folding**: Multiple memories competing for context space
2. **Folding process**: Compression and organization into structured categories
3. **After folding**: Clean, organized memory ready for new reasoning

---

## 💡 Explain: How It Learns with ToolPO

Training such an agent in the real world would be **painfully slow** — calling thousands of live APIs to learn which one works best? No thanks.

The researchers developed a clever method called **ToolPO** (Tool Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning approach where the agent practices using **simulated APIs** instead of real ones.

### The Learning Environment

- **It learns in a sandbox version of the internet**
- Each time it selects the right tool or completes a task efficiently, it receives a reward
- Over time, it doesn't just memorize solutions — it develops **a kind of instinct** for tool use

```python
reward = success_of_task + accuracy_of_tool_calls
update_policy(reward)
```

---

## 🎨 Visualize: ToolPO Learning Process

<ToolPOLearningVisualization />

The reinforcement learning visualization shows:
- **Policy Model**: DeepAgent's decision-making brain
- **Tool Simulator**: Safe sandbox environment for practice
- **Reward System**: Dual rewards for both task completion and tool accuracy
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuous improvement through trial and error

---

## 📊 The Numbers That Matter

DeepAgent isn't just an idea on paper. It was tested across **eight major benchmarks** — including ToolBench, WebShop, and GAIA, where agents must navigate complex, real-world scenarios.

### Performance Results

| Benchmark | DeepAgent | Traditional ReAct | Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **ToolBench** | 64% | 54% | +18.5% |
| **ToolHop** | 40.6% | 29% | +40% |
| **WebShop** | 32% | 18% | +77.8% |

**In short**: DeepAgent doesn't just plan better — it **adapts better**.

It learns:
- ✅ When to rethink
- ✅ When to explore
- ✅ When to stop and refocus

That's not just more efficient — **it's more human**.

## 🤔 Think: Why It Feels Like a Glimpse of What's Next

Reading about DeepAgent, I couldn't help but feel like this is where AI is slowly heading — toward systems that don't just react, but **reason**.

### The Evolution of AI Agents

Today's agents resemble **bright students who follow instructions perfectly**.

DeepAgent is more like **a student who asks, "Why are we doing it this way?"** and then seeks a better method.

That slight difference — **curiosity** — is what could eventually make AI genuinely valuable in the wild.

---

## 💭 Final Thoughts

When I first encountered the phrase "autonomous reasoning agent," I thought it was just another buzzword.

However, after diving into DeepAgent's design — how it manages memory, searches for tools, and learns through simulated APIs — it feels more like **a turning point**.

### This isn't just a tool that uses tools

**It's an AI that's learning how to become a toolmaker.**

And that, to me, seems like the actual start of intelligent systems that can:
- 🧠 **Reason** like humans
- 🔄 **Reflect** on their actions
- 🛠️ **Build** their own solutions

Almost like humans do.
